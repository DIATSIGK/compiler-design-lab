# Automata Concepts
### 1. Write program to find ε – closure of all states of any given NFA with ε transition.

Run ```g++ 1.1_e_closures_enfa.cpp && (cat ./inputs/1.1_input_1.txt | ./a.out)``` to compile.

### 2. Write program to convert NFA with ε transition to NFA without ε transition.

Run ```g++ 1.2_enfa_to_nfa.cpp && (cat inputs/1.1_input_1.txt | ./a.out ``` to compile.

### 3. Write program to convert NFA to DFA. 


### 4. Write program to minimize any given DFA.
